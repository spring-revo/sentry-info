# Sentry 

Sentry is an offline communication app using sms. This app lets you share news and track location or event as it happens with your trusted friends.
This app will help keep you in the loop about whatâ€™s happening around your vicinity while mobile data is being cut off in Myanmar. Oh SMS are fully encrypted btw and will be only visible among trusted contacts. This app works only with Myanmar sim operators. Hope this Sentry app takes a small part of the safe and fast glory to The Spring Revolution in Myanmar.

Please have a dedicated sim for Sentry and put it in the SIM1 slot or make it a default sim to send sms.
